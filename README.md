A Designer and Spatial Visualization tool for Silverlight 3
Argentum Tela is a design-time environment written entirely in Silverlight 2. Using this extensible framework, you can build cross platform Visio-esque applications in the browser. 
Argentum Tela is a Designer Framework for Silverlight 3. This framework can be used to create a drag and drop designer experience that should be familiar to users of Visual Studio, Expression Blend, or Visio. There are many cases where it can be useful to build a document by dragging and dropping controls and editing them on a designer surface. The framework is roughly based on idioms from the Windows Forms 2 design time experience, breaking from this where it makes sense to do so.

Implemented features:

-Toolbox

-Drag and drop to surface

-Control selection, moving, and scaling on the surface

-Property editing via a PropertyGrid

Future features:

-Serialization/Deserialization of the designer document state

-Pluggability using a "stencil set"

-Undo support, Designer transactions

-Configurable design surface behaviors

-snap lines

-rotate thumbs

-measurement adorners

-Full Screen support

-Zoom in/out

-Customizable look and feel

-Drawing/Connector support

-Future demo applications

-Slide show creator

-UML diagram

-An IoC container and some Composite UI constructs were created as part of building the overall solution.

-IoC container: ServiceManager. Supports dependency injection, automatic service proxy creation, and a builder strategy to supply dependencies

-A simple Event Aggregator

-A basic Region Manager

- Handy extension methods
